The project I did was a course registration project. That means you can buy courses from there if you want. Three features of my project are as follows:

Firstly, you will see nine courses here.

Secondly, you will see a "Select" button there.

Thirdly, if you click on that "Select" button, then your clicked course will be added to my cart section.And also Credit hours for the clicked course will be added to the section too.
